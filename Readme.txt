HI Sir/Mam,


	First of all I need to tell what is my understanding about the project. 
We need to create a seperate file for all the speakers in the conv.txt file, and write all the 
unique words (Repeated words not allowed) in the file in separate line.

	I've done the project with my understandings and hopefully it is right. Removed all special characters 
and make all the words in lowercase.In this project folder I've attached the solution file which is in 
the format of notebook named as "Project_Sol". And attached the seperate folder for text files with the 
Speaker names which I created in code.

	In the Solution file I've documented all the code I used, It will be easy for you to know the reason 
for why I wrote that line of code. And one doubt I mentioned in Comment for removing special characters, which 
keyword is used to remove the special character withour spaces? Please let me know in the feedback.

	I've mentioned another method to get the same result in the solution file at the bottom.
please kindly check all that lines and let me know if you find any error in the solution file.

		Thank You..
